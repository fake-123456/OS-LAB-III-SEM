# Bankerâ€™s Algorithm for Deadlock Prevention

Deadlocks in a system can be prevented by addressing the conditions that lead to deadlock. The Banker's Algorithm is designed to handle deadlock prevention by addressing specific aspects of resource allocation. There are four conditions to be considered:

## 1. Eliminate Mutual Exclusion

It is not feasible to eliminate mutual exclusion since certain resources, like tap drives and printers, are inherently non-shareable. Therefore, the mutual exclusion condition cannot be dis-satisfied.

## 2. Eliminate Hold and Wait

To eliminate the hold and wait condition, one approach is to allocate all required resources to a process before the start of its execution. While this prevents deadlock, it can lead to low device utilization, as resources are allocated upfront regardless of whether they are immediately needed.

## 3. Eliminate No Preemption

Preemption involves taking resources away from a process. To prevent deadlock, resources can be preempted from a process when they are required by another high-priority process. This ensures that resources are utilized efficiently and deadlock situations are avoided.

## 4. Eliminate Circular Wait

Circular wait can be eliminated by assigning a numerical number to each resource. Processes are then allowed to request resources only in increasing order of numbering. This restriction breaks the possibility of circular wait scenarios, contributing to deadlock prevention.

In summary, the Banker's Algorithm provides strategies for preventing deadlocks by addressing the hold and wait condition through resource allocation strategies, allowing preemption of resources when needed, and imposing a specific order for resource requests to eliminate circular wait possibilities. While mutual exclusion remains inherent in certain resources, the algorithm aims to mitigate deadlock risks in practical scenarios.
